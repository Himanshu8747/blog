      "body": "Lately, I’ve been noticing how my sentences have a tendency to keep going when I write them onscreen.\n This goes for concentrated writing as well as correspondence. (Twain probably believed that correspondence, \n in an ideal world, also demands concentration. But he never used email.)\n Last week I caught myself packing four conjunctions into a three-line sentence in an email. \n That’s inexcusable. Since then, I have tried to eschew conjunctions whenever possible. \n Gone are the commas, the and’s, but’s, and so’s; in are staccato declaratives. \n Better to read like bad Hemingway than bad Faulkner.",

      "title": "Deep Learning Paper",
      "body": "This book was written for anyone who wishes to explore deep learning from scratch or\nbroaden their understanding of deep learning. Whether you’re a practicing machine-learning engineer, a software developer, or a college student, you’ll find value in these pages.\n This book offers a practical, hands-on exploration of deep learning. It avoids mathematical notation, preferring instead to explain quantitative concepts via code snippets and to build practical intuition about the core ideas of machine learning and\ndeep learning. \n You’ll learn from more than 30 code examples that include detailed commentary,\npractical recommendations, and simple high-level explanations of everything you\nneed to know to start using deep learning to solve concrete problems.\n The code examples use the Python deep-learning framework Keras, with TensorFlow as a backend engine. Keras, one of the most popular and fastest-growing deeplearning frameworks, is widely recommended as the best tool to get started with deep\nlearning.",
